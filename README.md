# GitLab ðŸš€

An Op to simplify an opinionated GitLab workflow.

![GitLab Op](https://github.com/cto-ai/GitLab/blob/master/screens/gitlab.png?raw=true)

## Notice

Please note that this Op was built with SDK 1 and therefore is currently limited to CLI compatibility.

If you would like to interact with GitLab in Slack, please contact us in [our community](https://CTO.ai/community) and we can work with you to adopt this functionality.

## Requirements

To run this or any other Op, install the [Ops Platform](https://cto.ai/platform).

Find information about how to run and build Ops via the [Ops Platform Documentation](https://cto.ai/docs/overview)

This Op also requires an access token to interact with GitLab. Find the steps to create the access token at [https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html). Be sure to grant all scopes so the Op has it's full capability.

* Copy the access token and provide it when prompted the first time the Op runs.
  
* Your remote `origin` must be set to a valid GitLab project (BitBucket or GitHub origin's don't work with this op).

## Optional Setup

### API URL

The Op's default API URL is configured to `gitlab.com`. If you have a self-hosted instance of GitLab and wish to change the API URL, you can do so by setting the environment variable `GITLAB_URL=example.com`.

### GPG Key Signing

GPG signing for your commits can also be enabled. Provided that you already have a valid key added and configured be used with GitLab. Setup GPG signing with the following steps:

  1. Run this command in a bash terminal. Input your passphrase when prompted to copy your GPG key to your clipboard. `gpg -a --export-secret-keys <fingerprint> | cat -e | sed 's/\$/\\n/g' | pbcopy`
  2. Add the GPG key as an environment variable `GPG_KEY=key-from-clipboard`
  3. Add the GPG key's corresponding passphrase as an environment variable `GPG_PASSPHRASE=yourpassphrase`

## Usage

Running `ops run gitlab`, gives you a list of available commands to get you started.

## Local Development

To develop and run ops locally:

  1. Clone the repo `git clone <git URL>`
  2. `cd` into the directory and install dependancies with `npm install`
  3. Build the Op `ops build path/to/op`
  4. Run the Op from your local source code with `ops run path/to/op`

## Available Commands

All the commands start with `ops run gitlab`. From there, you would use the following commands to manage your GitLab flow.

* `project:create`

Initializes a new git repository in the current working directory and pushes to the user's selected Group or personal GitLab namespace.

* `project:clone`

* `issue:create`

Creates a new issue in GitLab. Current working directory must be a project either cloned or created using the project:create or project:clone commands.

* `issue:list`

Lists all the issues the user has access to. If the current working directory is a project in GitLab then the issues are scope by the project otherwise it displays all issues that you are assigned to or created by you etc.

* `issue:search`

Searches all issues in GitLab for your current working directory by selected filters.

* `issue:start`

Lists all issues in GitLab for your current working directory. Selecting a issue will checkout a branch for that issue and set the upstream in GitLab.

Adds all unstaged changes, commits and pushes to GitLab for the current working branch.

* `issue:done`

Converts the current working issue into a merge-request and allows you to assign reviewers.
